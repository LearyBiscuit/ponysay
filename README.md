## Install

`go get github.com/gillesdemey/ponysay`

## Features

It prints a random pony.

## Options

Really, there aren't any options.
It just prints an MLP:FiM character.

`ponysay` is the only command.

## Support

Only `xterm-256color` terminal types are supported. If yours is not, you're probably using a computer from yesteryear.

## FAQ

Q: Will you support [insert feature here]

A: Probably not, if you want a bazillion features and options take a look at [https://github.com/erkin/ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay)

Q: Why did you make this?

A: The original Ponysay is ~2500 lines of code and comes with a PDF that's 85(!) pages long.

Things could be much simpler.

I also like to explore new languages, Go being one of them and this project is fairly limited in scope.
